## Virtual-Painter
by using "ByCharm", just wave a pen in front of your webcam to draw something virtually and it actually draws it on the screen; has color detection (blue, orange, green), weâ€™ll use contour detection to detect and track the location of that pen all over the screen; and do not forget to use white background cuz it is very sensitive.
